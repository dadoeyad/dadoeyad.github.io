From now on I'm going to put an effort to write more and share my brilliant amazing might be stupid or obvious ideas and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to write about stuff, because stuff occur to me when I'm doing other stuff. And Because everyone on the Internet/programming communities/academic communities tell you to write. For many reasons including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing makes you a better writer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
With a lot of practice and mistakes you'll learn how to be a better writer. I terribly need this because writing "stuff" 3 times in a single sentence isn't really something you should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better visibility on the net and on the job market.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Writing about a programming language or a tool, or about a solution you've encountered will identify you as someone who actually knows what the technology/language/tool is about and knows how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaching will help you learn.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Writing a tutorial or a solution will make you dive more into the subject, trying to know as much as you can about the technology. In this process you'll discover many things you didn't know before and awards you with more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other personal why I want to start writing is that I'm really bored and trying to fill my time with something productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing about Python, Django, data science, and maybe personal experiences and cooking. Still not sure about that last part but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="writing"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry></feed>
